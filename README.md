# knockout_bindings

In this project you can see some knockout bindings that I've written or found throughout time.

This repo contains working examples for each knockout binding and assumes that knockout 3.2.x is being used.

Currently available bindings:

1. enter-press
  On Enter press perform an action, while pressing shift+Enter adds a new line to the input
